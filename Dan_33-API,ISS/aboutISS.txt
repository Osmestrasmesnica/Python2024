The International Space Station (ISS) is a habitable space station orbiting Earth, providing a unique platform for scientific research and international cooperation. It serves as a microgravity laboratory where astronauts from various countries conduct experiments across a wide range of fields, including biology, physics, astronomy, and Earth science.

Constructed through collaboration among multiple space agencies, including NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (European Space Agency), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency), the ISS has been continuously inhabited since November 2000. It orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 420 kilometers (about 260 miles) and travels at a speed of over 28,000 kilometers per hour (about 17,500 miles per hour), completing an orbit roughly every 90 minutes.

The ISS serves as a symbol of international cooperation in space exploration, with astronauts from different nations working together to conduct experiments, maintain the station, and further our understanding of the challenges and opportunities of living and working in space.
