# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Game Overview

### How to Play:
1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Enter the number of players (1 or 2) when prompted.
3. Choose whether you want to play as X or O.
4. Players take turns entering a number corresponding to the position they want to mark on the board.
5. The game ends when a player achieves a winning combination or when the board is filled with no winner.

### Features:
- Player vs. Player: Two players can compete against each other.
- Player vs. AI: If playing against the AI, it will make random moves.

### Game Logic:
- The game logic is implemented in `functions.py`.
- It includes functions to display the board, check for a winner, handle player input, and manage the game state.

## Files:
- `functions.py`: Contains all the game logic functions.
- `main.py`: Runs the game, displays the board, and manages player input.
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art for the Tic Tac Toe title.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run `main.py` in your preferred Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Gameplay Instructions:
- The game board is numbered from 1 to 9, representing each position.
- Enter the number corresponding to the position you want to mark.
- Win the game by getting three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Development Notes:
- The game was developed as a Python console application.
- ASCII art was used to create a visually appealing title for the game.

## Credits:
- This game was created by WLQ Innovations (Vlku A.) as a simple project to practice Python programming.
